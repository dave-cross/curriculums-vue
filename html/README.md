As you travel through this industry, you'll hear a lot about "tech stacks", bundles of code and technology that generate a _final_ website. At the heart of it are 3 languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

But only HTML is **mandatory**. HTML is the skeleton that we build websites with. All other _stacks_ ultimately output HTML. And the borwser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge) convert that HTML into what you see. Look in the developer tools for google.com, youtube.com, or any other website, and you'll see a familiar `<html>` _tag_ at the top of the code. I'd go so far to say that your ability to be a web developer is only as good as your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In this section, we begin to explore what HTML is and the syntax you'll use to write it. With this information, you can start to build any website UI.
