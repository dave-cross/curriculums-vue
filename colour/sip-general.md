# Sip: Getting Started

![The Sip Logo](/images/colour/logo-sip.svg)

[Sip](http://sipapp.io/) is a palette manager that lives in your menu bar and as a discreet “dock” on the edge of your screen. It allows you to collect, share, and use colours in various apps.

The great thing is that it can be used by both designers and developers, adding consistency to the entire process of building a product.

The settings include a bunch of different options for shortcuts, visible formats, number of palettes in the dock and backups (called snapshots).
