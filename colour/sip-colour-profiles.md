# Colour profiles and Sip

You might notice that picked colours have a different hex value than indicated inside a design app. This is because of differences in colour profiles.

You can fix this by changing the colour profile in Sip’s settings (if you know the profile).

A faster way to select the correct profile is to turn on the profile shortcuts in settings. Then, while the loupe is hovering over a known colour value, use the profile change shortcuts to find a profile that gives you the correct colours.

Many design apps and browsers have their own colour profile, so if you switch between multiple apps, you’ll have to be wary when you pick colours.

::: warning Note
If you're working in a multi-screen set-up, you'll want to make all your screens use the same colour profile if you want to capture colours from any screen.
