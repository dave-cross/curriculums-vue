# Sip: Working with Palettes

There are a number of different options for working with palettes. Work with palette colours by clicking the “two lollipops” icon in either the dock (while hovering over a palette) or the extra options next to  a name in the menu bar.

You can sort your colours by dragging and dropping. You can also sort colours directly in the dock or at the top-level view of the menubar window, which can be very useful for moving colours _between_ palettes.

If you need to make adjustments to a colour or create various shades of a colour, you can click the colour and make changes using the sliders or typing a new hexcode. Then, confirm the change with the check mark icon or add the new colour with the _duplicate_ icon.

Lock your palette to prevent adding new colours to it accidentally.

Favourite a palette. This makes it easy to display specific palettes.

You can also rename the colour too, but in practice, I haven’t been able to use this new name in production code.
