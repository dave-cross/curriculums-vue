# Iconjar: Sorting and Tagging
  
In iconjar, you can select icons and copy or move them to other groups using the contextual menu (“right clicking”).

Selecting any icon shows icon details in the right sidebar. Here, you can add tags and rename the icon as needed. You can also see file size and type or change individual licenses.

A great way to start a project is to gather or **copy** a bunch of potential icons into the _miscellaneous_ group. Then you can compare and prune the list until you have your finals. These can then be **moved** into their own group and shared across disciplines.
