# IconJar for  Designers  
  
Like most cross-discipline tools, iconjar is very easy to use for designers.   
  
Select a bunch of icons and start dragging them out of the app. The app will hide, allowing you to easily drop the icons into your design app. Any preset colours or sizing you've used will be included with the dropped icons.
