# IconJar: Sharing Icons

Traditionally, icons would be shared as individual files or inside of a project file. With IconJar, it’s easy to export a group of icons to an IconJar archive.

If other team members have IconJar, they can import that archive directly.

For those that done have IconJar, the archive is just a fancy folder. Right-clicking and selecting “show contents” will give you access to the individual files. You can also remove the \*.iconjar extension and it should display as a folder.
