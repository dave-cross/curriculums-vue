# IconJar: Starting Out

[IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/) is a digital shoebox for icons. It allows you to store, tag, organize, and retrieve icons. Depending on the formats used for stored icons, your entire indexed library can be tiny (at the time of this writing, I have 60,000 svg icons that take up around 70mb).

[Many icon designers](https://geticonjar.com/featured-icons/) are now including an IconJar archive that is pre-tagged/organized and quickly imported.
