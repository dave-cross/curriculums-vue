# Iconjar: Previewing Colours and Sizes
  
There are a few options while previewing icons. 

In the top right corner, you can select icon size and colour. This lets you quickly see how icons will look before picking them.

Change the main display to “dark mode” to preview light-coloured icons. When you drag icons into other apps, the selected colour and sizing will also be transferred with the icons.
