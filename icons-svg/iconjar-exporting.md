# IconJar: Exporting to Multiple Files

IconJar has a multi-image export feature. Using it, you can export a bunch of icons to a variety of formats in just a couple clicks.

Start by selecting one or more icons. When you're icons are picked, `cmd+click` to bring up the context menu and select `Export…`.

In the export modal, you'll have options to select what size, prefix, suffix, and format you want. For size, any unitless number will be width and height, but it's encouraged to add an `s` behind the number to signify that (ie. `150s` for 150px). You can also use the standard `x` as a multiplier (ie. `2x` is 2 ⨉ current width/height).

IconJar comes with a bunch of different presets for exporting, and it's easy to make your own custom ones too by saving the preset after you've set it all up.

Once your export is complete, IconJar will open a window showing all your output files.
